# Triangle Area and Validity VI

## Overview

This Virtual Instrument (VI) is designed to calculate the area of a triangle and determine its validity based on the input of three sides.

## Features

- **Triangle Area Calculation**: Computes the area using the given sides of the triangle.
- **Triangle Validity Check**: Verifies with boolean expression if the provided sides can form a valid triangle.
- **Input Requirements**: Accepts three numerical inputs representing the sides of the triangle.

## How to Use

1. **Input Sides**: Enter the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.
2. **Run the VI**: Execute the VI to calculate the area and check validity.
3. **View Results**: The area of the triangle and its validity status will be displayed.

## Validity Criteria
- Each of the sides of the triangle must be greater than zero

## Example

1. Input: Side A = 5, Side B = 4, Side C = 3
   - Output: Area = 6, Validity = Valid Triangle

2. Input: Side A = -7, Side B = 3, Side C = 2
   - Output: Area = N/A, Validity = Invalid Triangle

## Requirements

- LabVIEW software installed on your computer.
- Basic understanding of triangle geometry and input requirements.
