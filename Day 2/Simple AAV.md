# Data Analysis VI

## Overview

This Virtual Instrument (VI) is designed to analyze data using a simulated signal. It generates a sine wave signal, calculates its arithmetic mean, visualizes the data on a waveform graph, displays the average value, and writes the data to a measurement file.

## Features

- **Simulate Signal**: Generates a sine wave for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Calculates the arithmetic mean of the generated signal.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays the signal on a waveform graph.
- **Average Value Display**: Shows the calculated average value to the user.
- **Measurement File Output**: Writes the signal data and calculated average to a measurement file.

## How to Use

1. **Run the VI**: Start the VI to generate and analyze the signal.
2. **View Waveform Graph**: Observe the sine wave signal displayed on the waveform graph.
3. **Check Average Value**: The arithmetic mean of the signal will be shown.
4. **Output to Measurement File**: The signal data and average value will be written to a measurement file for further analysis.

## Requirements

- LabVIEW software installed on your computer.
- Basic understanding of Virtual Instruments and data analysis.

## Example

1. **Simulated Signal**: A sine wave is generated.
2. **Arithmetic Mean**: The average value of the sine wave is calculated.
3. **Waveform Graph**: The sine wave is visualized on the graph.
4. **Measurement File**: Data is saved to a file for record-keeping or further analysis.

NB: AAV means Acquire, Analyze and Visualize Data
